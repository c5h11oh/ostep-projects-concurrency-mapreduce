Lock-based Concurrent Data Structures
Before moving beyond locks, we’ll first describe how to use locks in some
common data structures. Adding locks to a data structure to make it usable by threads makes the structure thread safe. Of course, exactly how
such locks are added determines both the correctness and performance of
the data structure. And thus, our challenge:
C RUX : H OW T O A DD L OCKS T O D ATA S TRUCTURES
When given a particular data structure, how should we add locks to
it, in order to make it work correctly? Further, how do we add locks such
that the data structure yields high performance, enabling many threads
to access the structure at once, i.e., concurrently?
Of course, we will be hard pressed to cover all data structures or all
methods for adding concurrency, as this is a topic that has been studied
for years, with (literally) thousands of research papers published about
it. Thus, we hope to provide a sufficient introduction to the type of thinking required, and refer you to some good sources of material for further
inquiry on your own. We found Moir and Shavit’s survey to be a great
source of information [MS04].

29.1 Concurrent Counters
One of the simplest data structures is a counter. It is a structure that
is commonly used and has a simple interface. We define a simple nonconcurrent counter in Figure 29.1.

Simple But Not Scalable
As you can see, the non-synchronized counter is a trivial data structure,
requiring a tiny amount of code to implement. We now have our next
challenge: how can we make this code thread safe? Figure 29.2 shows
how we do so.

Figure 29.1: A Counter Without Locks
This concurrent counter is simple and works correctly. In fact, it follows a design pattern common to the simplest and most basic concurrent
data structures: it simply adds a single lock, which is acquired when calling a routine that manipulates the data structure, and is released when
returning from the call. In this manner, it is similar to a data structure
built with monitors [BH73], where locks are acquired and released automatically as you call and return from object methods.
At this point, you have a working concurrent data structure. The problem you might have is performance. If your data structure is too slow,
you’ll have to do more than just add a single lock; such optimizations, if
needed, are thus the topic of the rest of the chapter. Note that if the data
structure is not too slow, you are done! No need to do something fancy if
something simple will work.
To understand the performance costs of the simple approach, we run a
benchmark in which each thread updates a single shared counter a fixed
number of times; we then vary the number of threads. Figure 29.5 shows
the total time taken, with one to four threads active; each thread updates
the counter one million times. This experiment was run upon an iMac
with four Intel 2.7 GHz i5 CPUs; with more CPUs active, we hope to get
more total work done per unit time.
From the top line in the figure (labeled ’Precise’), you can see that the
performance of the synchronized counter scales poorly. Whereas a single
thread can complete the million counter updates in a tiny amount of time
(roughly 0.03 seconds), having two threads each update the counter one
million times concurrently leads to a massive slowdown (taking over 5
seconds!). It only gets worse with more threads.

Figure 29.2: A Counter With Locks
Ideally, you’d like to see the threads complete just as quickly on multiple processors as the single thread does on one. Achieving this end is
called perfect scaling; even though more work is done, it is done in parallel, and hence the time taken to complete the task is not increased.

Scalable Counting
Amazingly, researchers have studied how to build more scalable counters for years [MS04]. Even more amazing is the fact that scalable counters matter, as recent work in operating system performance analysis has
shown [B+10]; without scalable counting, some workloads running on
Linux suffer from serious scalability problems on multicore machines.
Many techniques have been developed to attack this problem. We’ll
describe one approach known as an approximate counter [C06].
The approximate counter works by representing a single logical counter
via numerous local physical counters, one per CPU core, as well as a single
global counter. Specifically, on a machine with four CPUs, there are four

local counters and one global one. In addition to these counters, there are
also locks: one for each local counter1 , and one for the global counter.
The basic idea of approximate counting is as follows. When a thread
running on a given core wishes to increment the counter, it increments its
local counter; access to this local counter is synchronized via the corresponding local lock. Because each CPU has its own local counter, threads
across CPUs can update local counters without contention, and thus updates to the counter are scalable.
However, to keep the global counter up to date (in case a thread wishes
to read its value), the local values are periodically transferred to the global
counter, by acquiring the global lock and incrementing it by the local
counter’s value; the local counter is then reset to zero.
How often this local-to-global transfer occurs is determined by a threshold S. The smaller S is, the more the counter behaves like the non-scalable
counter above; the bigger S is, the more scalable the counter, but the further off the global value might be from the actual count. One could simply acquire all the local locks and the global lock (in a specified order, to
avoid deadlock) to get an exact value, but that is not scalable.
To make this clear, let’s look at an example (Figure 29.3). In this example, the threshold S is set to 5, and there are threads on each of four
CPUs updating their local counters L1 ... L4 . The global counter value
(G) is also shown in the trace, with time increasing downward. At each
time step, a local counter may be incremented; if the local value reaches
the threshold S, the local value is transferred to the global counter and
the local counter is reset.
The lower line in Figure 29.5 (labeled ’Approximate’, on page 6) shows
the performance of approximate counters with a threshold S of 1024. Performance is excellent; the time taken to update the counter four million
times on four processors is hardly higher than the time taken to update it
one million times on one processor.

We need the local locks because we assume there may be more than one thread on each
core. If, instead, only one thread ran on each core, no local lock would be needed.

Figure 29.6 shows the importance of the threshold value S, with four
threads each incrementing the counter 1 million times on four CPUs. If S
is low, performance is poor (but the global count is always quite accurate);
if S is high, performance is excellent, but the global count lags (by at most
the number of CPUs multiplied by S). This accuracy/performance tradeoff is what approximate counters enable.
A rough version of an approximate counter is found in Figure 29.4
(page 5). Read it, or better yet, run it yourself in some experiments to
better understand how it works.

If the scheme you design adds a lot of overhead (for example, by acquiring and releasing locks frequently, instead of once), the fact that it is more
concurrent may not be important. Simple schemes tend to work well,
especially if they use costly routines rarely. Adding more locks and complexity can be your downfall. All of that said, there is one way to really
know: build both alternatives (simple but less concurrent, and complex
but more concurrent) and measure how they do. In the end, you can’t
cheat on performance; your idea is either faster, or it isn’t.

29.2 Concurrent Linked Lists
We next examine a more complicated structure, the linked list. Let’s
start with a basic approach once again. For simplicity, we’ll omit some of
the obvious routines that such a list would have and just focus on concurrent insert; we’ll leave it to the reader to think about lookup, delete, and
so forth. Figure 29.7 shows the code for this rudimentary data structure.
As you can see in the code, the code simply acquires a lock in the insert
routine upon entry, and releases it upon exit. One small tricky issue arises
if malloc() happens to fail (a rare case); in this case, the code must also
release the lock before failing the insert.
This kind of exceptional control flow has been shown to be quite error
prone; a recent study of Linux kernel patches found that a huge fraction of
bugs (nearly 40%) are found on such rarely-taken code paths (indeed, this
observation sparked some of our own research, in which we removed all
memory-failing paths from a Linux file system, resulting in a more robust
system [S+11]).
Thus, a challenge: can we rewrite the insert and lookup routines to remain correct under concurrent insert but avoid the case where the failure
path also requires us to add the call to unlock?
The answer, in this case, is yes. Specifically, we can rearrange the code
a bit so that the lock and release only surround the actual critical section
in the insert code, and that a common exit path is used in the lookup code.
The former works because part of the insert actually need not be locked;
assuming that malloc() itself is thread-safe, each thread can call into it
without worry of race conditions or other concurrency bugs. Only when
updating the shared list does a lock need to be held. See Figure 29.8 for
the details of these modifications.
As for the lookup routine, it is a simple code transformation to jump
out of the main search loop to a single return path. Doing so again reduces the number of lock acquire/release points in the code, and thus
decreases the chances of accidentally introducing bugs (such as forgetting to unlock before returning) into the code.

Scaling Linked Lists
Though we again have a basic concurrent linked list, once again we are
in a situation where it does not scale particularly well. One technique
that researchers have explored to enable more concurrency within a list is
something called hand-over-hand locking (a.k.a. lock coupling) [MS04].
The idea is pretty simple. Instead of having a single lock for the entire
list, you instead add a lock per node of the list. When traversing the
list, the code first grabs the next node’s lock and then releases the current
node’s lock (which inspires the name hand-over-hand).

A general design tip, which is useful in concurrent code as well as elsewhere, is to be wary of control flow changes that lead to function returns,
exits, or other similar error conditions that halt the execution of a function. Because many functions will begin by acquiring a lock, allocating
some memory, or doing other similar stateful operations, when errors
arise, the code has to undo all of the state before returning, which is errorprone. Thus, it is best to structure code to minimize this pattern.

Conceptually, a hand-over-hand linked list makes some sense; it enables a high degree of concurrency in list operations. However, in practice, it is hard to make such a structure faster than the simple single lock
approach, as the overheads of acquiring and releasing locks for each node
of a list traversal is prohibitive. Even with very large lists, and a large
number of threads, the concurrency enabled by allowing multiple ongoing traversals is unlikely to be faster than simply grabbing a single
lock, performing an operation, and releasing it. Perhaps some kind of hybrid (where you grab a new lock every so many nodes) would be worth
investigating.

29.3

Concurrent Queues
As you know by now, there is always a standard method to make a
concurrent data structure: add a big lock. For a queue, we’ll skip that
approach, assuming you can figure it out.
Instead, we’ll take a look at a slightly more concurrent queue designed
by Michael and Scott [MS98]. The data structures and code used for this
queue are found in Figure 29.9 on the following page.
If you study this code carefully, you’ll notice that there are two locks,
one for the head of the queue, and one for the tail. The goal of these two
locks is to enable concurrency of enqueue and dequeue operations. In
the common case, the enqueue routine will only access the tail lock, and
dequeue only the head lock.
One trick used by Michael and Scott is to add a dummy node (allocated in the queue initialization code); this dummy enables the separation of head and tail operations. Study the code, or better yet, type it in,
run it, and measure it, to understand how it works deeply.
Queues are commonly used in multi-threaded applications. However,
the type of queue used here (with just locks) often does not completely
meet the needs of such programs. A more fully developed bounded
queue, that enables a thread to wait if the queue is either empty or overly
full, is the subject of our intense study in the next chapter on condition
variables. Watch for it!

Concurrent Hash Table
We end our discussion with a simple and widely applicable concurrent
data structure, the hash table. We’ll focus on a simple hash table that does
not resize; a little more work is required to handle resizing, which we
leave as an exercise for the reader (sorry!).
This concurrent hash table (Figure 29.10) is straightforward, is built using the concurrent lists we developed earlier, and works incredibly well.
The reason for its good performance is that instead of having a single
lock for the entire structure, it uses a lock per hash bucket (each of which
is represented by a list). Doing so enables many concurrent operations to
take place.
Figure 29.11 shows the performance of the hash table under concurrent updates (from 10,000 to 50,000 concurrent updates from each of four
threads, on the same iMac with four CPUs). Also shown, for the sake
of comparison, is the performance of a linked list (with a single lock).
As you can see from the graph, this simple concurrent hash table scales
magnificently; the linked list, in contrast, does not.

29.5

Summary
We have introduced a sampling of concurrent data structures, from
counters, to lists and queues, and finally to the ubiquitous and heavilyused hash table. We have learned a few important lessons along the way:
to be careful with acquisition and release of locks around control flow

changes; that enabling more concurrency does not necessarily increase
performance; that performance problems should only be remedied once
they exist. This last point, of avoiding premature optimization, is central to any performance-minded developer; there is no value in making
something faster if doing so will not improve the overall performance of
the application.
Of course, we have just scratched the surface of high performance
structures. See Moir and Shavit’s excellent survey for more information,
as well as links to other sources [MS04]. In particular, you might be interested in other structures (such as B-trees); for this knowledge, a database
class is your best bet. You also might be curious about techniques that
don’t use traditional locks at all; such non-blocking data structures are
something we’ll get a taste of in the chapter on common concurrency
bugs, but frankly this topic is an entire area of knowledge requiring more
study than is possible in this humble book. Find out more on your own
if you desire (as always!).

By doing so, you are likely to build a correct lock; if you then find that it
suffers from performance problems, you can refine it, thus only making
it fast if need be. As Knuth famously stated, “Premature optimization is
the root of all evil.”
Many operating systems utilized a single lock when first transitioning
to multiprocessors, including Sun OS and Linux. In the latter, this lock
even had a name, the big kernel lock (BKL). For many years, this simple approach was a good one, but when multi-CPU systems became the
norm, only allowing a single active thread in the kernel at a time became
a performance bottleneck. Thus, it was finally time to add the optimization of improved concurrency to these systems. Within Linux, the more
straightforward approach was taken: replace one lock with many. Within
Sun, a more radical decision was made: build a brand new operating system, known as Solaris, that incorporates concurrency more fundamentally from day one. Read the Linux and Solaris kernel books for more
information about these fascinating systems [BC05, MM00].

Homework (Code)
In this homework, you’ll gain some experience with writing concurrent code and measuring its performance. Learning to build code that
performs well is a critical skill and thus gaining a little experience here
with it is quite worthwhile.

Questions
1. We’ll start by redoing the measurements within this chapter. Use
the call gettimeofday() to measure time within your program.
How accurate is this timer? What is the smallest interval it can measure? Gain confidence in its workings, as we will need it in all subsequent questions. You can also look into other timers, such as the
cycle counter available on x86 via the rdtsc instruction.
2. Now, build a simple concurrent counter and measure how long it
takes to increment the counter many times as the number of threads
increases. How many CPUs are available on the system you are
using? Does this number impact your measurements at all?
3. Next, build a version of the sloppy counter. Once again, measure its
performance as the number of threads varies, as well as the threshold. Do the numbers match what you see in the chapter?
4. Build a version of a linked list that uses hand-over-hand locking
[MS04], as cited in the chapter. You should read the paper first
to understand how it works, and then implement it. Measure its
performance. When does a hand-over-hand list work better than a
standard list as shown in the chapter?
5. Pick your favorite data structure, such as a B-tree or other slightly
more interesting structure. Implement it, and start with a simple
locking strategy such as a single lock. Measure its performance as
the number of concurrent threads increases.
6. Finally, think of a more interesting locking strategy for this favorite
data structure of yours. Implement it, and measure its performance.
How does it compare to the straightforward locking approach?
