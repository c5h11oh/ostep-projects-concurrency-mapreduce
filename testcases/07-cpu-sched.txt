Scheduling: Introduction

By now low-level mechanisms of running processes (e.g., context switching) should be clear; if they are not, go back a chapter or two, and read the
description of how that stuff works again. However, we have yet to understand the high-level policies that an OS scheduler employs. We will
now do just that, presenting a series of scheduling policies (sometimes
called disciplines) that various smart and hard-working people have developed over the years.
The origins of scheduling, in fact, predate computer systems; early
approaches were taken from the field of operations management and applied to computers. This reality should be no surprise: assembly lines
and many other human endeavors also require scheduling, and many of
the same concerns exist therein, including a laser-like desire for efficiency.
And thus, our problem:
T HE C RUX : H OW T O D EVELOP S CHEDULING P OLICY
How should we develop a basic framework for thinking about
scheduling policies? What are the key assumptions? What metrics are
important? What basic approaches have been used in the earliest of computer systems?

7.1 Workload Assumptions
Before getting into the range of possible policies, let us first make a
number of simplifying assumptions about the processes running in the
system, sometimes collectively called the workload. Determining the
workload is a critical part of building policies, and the more you know
about workload, the more fine-tuned your policy can be.
The workload assumptions we make here are mostly unrealistic, but
that is alright (for now), because we will relax them as we go, and eventually develop what we will refer to as ... (dramatic pause) ...

a fully-operational scheduling discipline1 .
We will make the following assumptions about the processes, sometimes called jobs, that are running in the system:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Each job runs for the same amount of time.
All jobs arrive at the same time.
Once started, each job runs to completion.
All jobs only use the CPU (i.e., they perform no I/O)
The run-time of each job is known.

We said many of these assumptions were unrealistic, but just as some
animals are more equal than others in Orwell’s Animal Farm [O45], some
assumptions are more unrealistic than others in this chapter. In particular, it might bother you that the run-time of each job is known: this would
make the scheduler omniscient, which, although it would be great (probably), is not likely to happen anytime soon.

7.2

Scheduling Metrics
Beyond making workload assumptions, we also need one more thing
to enable us to compare different scheduling policies: a scheduling metric. A metric is just something that we use to measure something, and
there are a number of different metrics that make sense in scheduling.
For now, however, let us also simplify our life by simply having a single metric: turnaround time. The turnaround time of a job is defined
as the time at which the job completes minus the time at which the job
arrived in the system. More formally, the turnaround time Tturnaround is:
Tturnaround = Tcompletion − Tarrival

(7.1)

Because we have assumed that all jobs arrive at the same time, for now
Tarrival = 0 and hence Tturnaround = Tcompletion . This fact will change
as we relax the aforementioned assumptions.
You should note that turnaround time is a performance metric, which
will be our primary focus this chapter. Another metric of interest is fairness, as measured (for example) by Jain’s Fairness Index [J91]. Performance and fairness are often at odds in scheduling; a scheduler, for example, may optimize performance but at the cost of preventing a few jobs
from running, thus decreasing fairness. This conundrum shows us that
life isn’t always perfect.

7.3

First In, First Out (FIFO)
The most basic algorithm we can implement is known as First In, First
Out (FIFO) scheduling or sometimes First Come, First Served (FCFS).

FIFO has a number of positive properties: it is clearly simple and thus
easy to implement. And, given our assumptions, it works pretty well.
Let’s do a quick example together. Imagine three jobs arrive in the
system, A, B, and C, at roughly the same time (Tarrival = 0). Because
FIFO has to put some job first, let’s assume that while they all arrived
simultaneously, A arrived just a hair before B which arrived just a hair
before C. Assume also that each job runs for 10 seconds. What will the
average turnaround time be for these jobs?

Figure 7.1: FIFO Simple Example
From Figure 7.1, you can see that A finished at 10, B at 20, and C at 30.
Thus, the average turnaround time for the three jobs is simply 10+20+30

20. Computing turnaround time is as easy as that.
Now let’s relax one of our assumptions. In particular, let’s relax assumption 1, and thus no longer assume that each job runs for the same
amount of time. How does FIFO perform now? What kind of workload
could you construct to make FIFO perform poorly?
(think about this before reading on ... keep thinking ... got it?!)
Presumably you’ve figured this out by now, but just in case, let’s do
an example to show how jobs of different lengths can lead to trouble for
FIFO scheduling. In particular, let’s again assume three jobs (A, B, and
C), but this time A runs for 100 seconds while B and C run for 10 each.

T IP : T HE P RINCIPLE OF SJF
Shortest Job First represents a general scheduling principle that can be
applied to any system where the perceived turnaround time per customer
(or, in our case, a job) matters. Think of any line you have waited in: if
the establishment in question cares about customer satisfaction, it is likely
they have taken SJF into account. For example, grocery stores commonly
have a “ten-items-or-less” line to ensure that shoppers with only a few
things to purchase don’t get stuck behind the family preparing for some
upcoming nuclear winter.
behind a heavyweight resource consumer. This scheduling scenario might
remind you of a single line at a grocery store and what you feel like when
you see the person in front of you with three carts full of provisions and
a checkbook out; it’s going to be a while2 .
So what should we do? How can we develop a better algorithm to
deal with our new reality of jobs that run for different amounts of time?
Think about it first; then read on.

7.4

Shortest Job First (SJF)
It turns out that a very simple approach solves this problem; in fact
it is an idea stolen from operations research [C54,PV56] and applied to
scheduling of jobs in computer systems. This new scheduling discipline
is known as Shortest Job First (SJF), and the name should be easy to
remember because it describes the policy quite completely: it runs the
shortest job first, then the next shortest, and so on.

A SIDE : P REEMPTIVE S CHEDULERS
In the old days of batch computing, a number of non-preemptive schedulers were developed; such systems would run each job to completion
before considering whether to run a new job. Virtually all modern schedulers are preemptive, and quite willing to stop one process from running in order to run another. This implies that the scheduler employs the
mechanisms we learned about previously; in particular, the scheduler can
perform a context switch, stopping one running process temporarily and
resuming (or starting) another.
In fact, given our assumptions about jobs all arriving at the same time,
we could prove that SJF is indeed an optimal scheduling algorithm. However, you are in a systems class, not theory or operations research; no
proofs are allowed.
Thus we arrive upon a good approach to scheduling with SJF, but our
assumptions are still fairly unrealistic. Let’s relax another. In particular,
we can target assumption 2, and now assume that jobs can arrive at any
time instead of all at once. What problems does this lead to?
(Another pause to think ... are you thinking? Come on, you can do it)
Here we can illustrate the problem again with an example. This time,
assume A arrives at t = 0 and needs to run for 100 seconds, whereas B
and C arrive at t = 10 and each need to run for 10 seconds. With pure
SJF, we’d get the schedule seen in Figure 7.4.

7.5 Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF)
To address this concern, we need to relax assumption 3 (that jobs must
run to completion), so let’s do that. We also need some machinery within
the scheduler itself. As you might have guessed, given our previous discussion about timer interrupts and context switching, the scheduler can

Figure 7.5: STCF Simple Example
certainly do something else when B and C arrive: it can preempt job A
and decide to run another job, perhaps continuing A later. SJF by our definition is a non-preemptive scheduler, and thus suffers from the problems
described above.
Fortunately, there is a scheduler which does exactly that: add preemption to SJF, known as the Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF) or
Preemptive Shortest Job First (PSJF) scheduler [CK68]. Any time a new
job enters the system, the STCF scheduler determines which of the remaining jobs (including the new job) has the least time left, and schedules
that one. Thus, in our example, STCF would preempt A and run B and C
to completion; only when they are finished would A’s remaining time be
scheduled. Figure 7.5 shows an example.
The result is a much-improved average turnaround time: 50 seconds
). And as before, given our new assumptions,
( (120−0)+(20−10)+(30−10)
3
STCF is provably optimal; given that SJF is optimal if all jobs arrive at
the same time, you should probably be able to see the intuition behind
the optimality of STCF.

7.6

A New Metric: Response Time
Thus, if we knew job lengths, and that jobs only used the CPU, and our
only metric was turnaround time, STCF would be a great policy. In fact,
for a number of early batch computing systems, these types of scheduling
algorithms made some sense. However, the introduction of time-shared
machines changed all that. Now users would sit at a terminal and demand interactive performance from the system as well. And thus, a new
metric was born: response time.
We define response time as the time from when the job arrives in a
system to the first time it is scheduled3 . More formally:
Tresponse = Tf irstrun − Tarrival

(7.2)

3
Some define it slightly differently, e.g., to also include the time until the job produces
some kind of “response”; our definition is the best-case version of this, essentially assuming
that the job produces a response instantaneously.

Figure 7.7: Round Robin (Good For Response Time)
For example, if we had the schedule above (with A arriving at time 0,
and B and C at time 10), the response time of each job is as follows: 0 for
job A, 0 for B, and 10 for C (average: 3.33).
As you might be thinking, STCF and related disciplines are not particularly good for response time. If three jobs arrive at the same time,
for example, the third job has to wait for the previous two jobs to run in
their entirety before being scheduled just once. While great for turnaround
time, this approach is quite bad for response time and interactivity. Indeed, imagine sitting at a terminal, typing, and having to wait 10 seconds
to see a response from the system just because some other job got scheduled in front of yours: not too pleasant.
Thus, we are left with another problem: how can we build a scheduler
that is sensitive to response time?

7.7 Round Robin
To solve this problem, we will introduce a new scheduling algorithm,
classically referred to as Round-Robin (RR) scheduling [K64]. The basic
idea is simple: instead of running jobs to completion, RR runs a job for a
time slice (sometimes called a scheduling quantum) and then switches
to the next job in the run queue. It repeatedly does so until the jobs are
finished. For this reason, RR is sometimes called time-slicing. Note that
the length of a time slice must be a multiple of the timer-interrupt period;
thus if the timer interrupts every 10 milliseconds, the time slice could be
10, 20, or any other multiple of 10 ms.
To understand RR in more detail, let’s look at an example. Assume
three jobs A, B, and C arrive at the same time in the system, and that

T IP : A MORTIZATION C AN R EDUCE C OSTS
The general technique of amortization is commonly used in systems
when there is a fixed cost to some operation. By incurring that cost less
often (i.e., by performing the operation fewer times), the total cost to the
system is reduced. For example, if the time slice is set to 10 ms, and the
context-switch cost is 1 ms, roughly 10% of time is spent context switching and is thus wasted. If we want to amortize this cost, we can increase
the time slice, e.g., to 100 ms. In this case, less than 1% of time is spent
context switching, and thus the cost of time-slicing has been amortized.
they each wish to run for 5 seconds. An SJF scheduler runs each job to
completion before running another (Figure 7.6). In contrast, RR with a
time-slice of 1 second would cycle through the jobs quickly (Figure 7.7).
The average response time of RR is: 0+1+2
= 1; for SJF, average re3
=
5.
sponse time is: 0+5+10
3
As you can see, the length of the time slice is critical for RR. The shorter
it is, the better the performance of RR under the response-time metric.
However, making the time slice too short is problematic: suddenly the
cost of context switching will dominate overall performance. Thus, deciding on the length of the time slice presents a trade-off to a system designer, making it long enough to amortize the cost of switching without
making it so long that the system is no longer responsive.
Note that the cost of context switching does not arise solely from the
OS actions of saving and restoring a few registers. When programs run,
they build up a great deal of state in CPU caches, TLBs, branch predictors,
and other on-chip hardware. Switching to another job causes this state
to be flushed and new state relevant to the currently-running job to be
brought in, which may exact a noticeable performance cost [MB91].
RR, with a reasonable time slice, is thus an excellent scheduler if response time is our only metric. But what about our old friend turnaround
time? Let’s look at our example above again. A, B, and C, each with running times of 5 seconds, arrive at the same time, and RR is the scheduler
with a (long) 1-second time slice. We can see from the picture above that
A finishes at 13, B at 14, and C at 15, for an average of 14. Pretty awful!
It is not surprising, then, that RR is indeed one of the worst policies if
turnaround time is our metric. Intuitively, this should make sense: what
RR is doing is stretching out each job as long as it can, by only running
each job for a short bit before moving to the next. Because turnaround
time only cares about when jobs finish, RR is nearly pessimal, even worse
than simple FIFO in many cases.
More generally, any policy (such as RR) that is fair, i.e., that evenly divides the CPU among active processes on a small time scale, will perform
poorly on metrics such as turnaround time. Indeed, this is an inherent
trade-off: if you are willing to be unfair, you can run shorter jobs to completion, but at the cost of response time; if you instead value fairness,

T IP : O VERLAP E NABLES H IGHER U TILIZATION
When possible, overlap operations to maximize the utilization of systems. Overlap is useful in many different domains, including when performing disk I/O or sending messages to remote machines; in either case,
starting the operation and then switching to other work is a good idea,
and improves the overall utilization and efficiency of the system.
response time is lowered, but at the cost of turnaround time. This type of
trade-off is common in systems; you can’t have your cake and eat it too4 .
We have developed two types of schedulers. The first type (SJF, STCF)
optimizes turnaround time, but is bad for response time. The second type
(RR) optimizes response time but is bad for turnaround. And we still
have two assumptions which need to be relaxed: assumption 4 (that jobs
do no I/O), and assumption 5 (that the run-time of each job is known).
Let’s tackle those assumptions next.

7.8 Incorporating I/O
First we will relax assumption 4 — of course all programs perform
I/O. Imagine a program that didn’t take any input: it would produce the
same output each time. Imagine one without output: it is the proverbial
tree falling in the forest, with no one to see it; it doesn’t matter that it ran.
A scheduler clearly has a decision to make when a job initiates an I/O
request, because the currently-running job won’t be using the CPU during the I/O; it is blocked waiting for I/O completion. If the I/O is sent to
a hard disk drive, the process might be blocked for a few milliseconds or
longer, depending on the current I/O load of the drive. Thus, the scheduler should probably schedule another job on the CPU at that time.
The scheduler also has to make a decision when the I/O completes.
When that occurs, an interrupt is raised, and the OS runs and moves
the process that issued the I/O from blocked back to the ready state. Of
course, it could even decide to run the job at that point. How should the
OS treat each job?
To understand this issue better, let us assume we have two jobs, A and
B, which each need 50 ms of CPU time. However, there is one obvious
difference: A runs for 10 ms and then issues an I/O request (assume here
that I/Os each take 10 ms), whereas B simply uses the CPU for 50 ms and
performs no I/O. The scheduler runs A first, then B after (Figure 7.8).
Assume we are trying to build a STCF scheduler. How should such a
scheduler account for the fact that A is broken up into 5 10-ms sub-jobs,
4
A saying that confuses people, because it should be “You can’t keep your cake and eat it
too” (which is kind of obvious, no?). Amazingly, there is a wikipedia page about this saying;
even more amazingly, it is kind of fun to read [W15]. As they say in Italian, you can’t Avere la

Figure 7.9: Overlap Allows Better Use Of Resources
whereas B is just a single 50-ms CPU demand? Clearly, just running one
job and then the other without considering how to take I/O into account
makes little sense.
A common approach is to treat each 10-ms sub-job of A as an independent job. Thus, when the system starts, its choice is whether to schedule
a 10-ms A or a 50-ms B. With STCF, the choice is clear: choose the shorter
one, in this case A. Then, when the first sub-job of A has completed, only
B is left, and it begins running. Then a new sub-job of A is submitted,
and it preempts B and runs for 10 ms. Doing so allows for overlap, with
the CPU being used by one process while waiting for the I/O of another
process to complete; the system is thus better utilized (see Figure 7.9).
And thus we see how a scheduler might incorporate I/O. By treating
each CPU burst as a job, the scheduler makes sure processes that are “interactive” get run frequently. While those interactive jobs are performing
I/O, other CPU-intensive jobs run, thus better utilizing the processor.

7.9

No More Oracle
With a basic approach to I/O in place, we come to our final assumption: that the scheduler knows the length of each job. As we said before,
this is likely the worst assumption we could make. In fact, in a generalpurpose OS (like the ones we care about), the OS usually knows very little
about the length of each job. Thus, how can we build an approach that behaves like SJF/STCF without such a priori knowledge? Further, how can
we incorporate some of the ideas we have seen with the RR scheduler so
that response time is also quite good?

7.10 Summary
We have introduced the basic ideas behind scheduling and developed
two families of approaches. The first runs the shortest job remaining and
thus optimizes turnaround time; the second alternates between all jobs
and thus optimizes response time. Both are bad where the other is good,
alas, an inherent trade-off common in systems. We have also seen how we
might incorporate I/O into the picture, but have still not solved the problem of the fundamental inability of the OS to see into the future. Shortly,
we will see how to overcome this problem, by building a scheduler that
uses the recent past to predict the future. This scheduler is known as the
multi-level feedback queue, and it is the topic of the next chapter.
